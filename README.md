Minecraft mappings for b1.7.3 based on work from [**biny-mappings**](https://github.com/calmilamsy/biny-mappings)
and [**babric**](https://github.com/babric/intermediary). I am not the original author. This project uses Python 3.13.2 for scripts and is licensed under MIT license for derivative works, though you will likely never create any.

"Corsairs" was chosen as the project name for the fact that this project relies on someone else's hardwork. Sorry.
